# Include the default entries shipped with ExtUtils:

#!include_default

# Each line is a regular expression. If the path to a file (relative to the
# top-level dir of the dist) matches, it will not be included in the tarcall
# when "make dist" (or equivalent) is run. Also, IIRC, matching files/dirs
# will not be cleaned up during a "make clean" (or equivalent)

### HQT-specific files & dirs to skip when packaging

# skip dirs containing libs installed from CPAN by setup-hqt
\b\.extlib/
\bextlib/

# skip any files with "example" in the name under various directories...
# Though normally there are "easier ways" to do this, over an hour of testing
# and experimentation showed me that those other ways don't work. (especially
# interesting/frustrating... setting the 'x' modifier doesn't work - *at all*)
\bconf/(?i:.*example.*$(*COMMIT)(*FAIL)|.+)
\bquery_templates/(?i:.*example.*$(*COMMIT)(*FAIL)|.+)

# keep the "data" dir, but skip anything inside it
\bdata/.+

### Other stuff to skip

# No need for a MANIFEST.SKIP in a released dist!
\bMANIFEST\.SKIP.*

# Eclipse & EPIC files
\b\.project
\b\.ignorepath
\b\.includepath
\b\.settings/

# this is my own thing for setting svn ignores
\b\.svnignore

# don't package Dist::Zilla & Pod::Weaver stuff in a dist
\bdist.ini
\bweaver.ini

# packages & archive files in the root dir
\b[^/]+\.(?i:tar|tgz|tbz2?|gz|bz2?|zip)$


### My personal prefs:
\bmy-tools/
\bdev-tools/
\bauthor-tools/
\brelease-tools/
